# About GLC

## GLC - Git a Load Of Charts

Git a Load Of Charts is a React Application that allows you to search for a specific GitHub item you want to find and getting the results back in chart format. For example, you can find how many pull request have been made in a specified repo. Think of it the way you think of performing a search on Google. It's designed to help you find the one result you're looking for (or maybe the few results you're looking for). Just like searching on Google, you sometimes want to see a few pages of search results so that you can find the item that best meets your needs.
